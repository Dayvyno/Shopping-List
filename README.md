# Shopping-List
This is a small project that is capable of doing the following:
Click an item on the list to have a strikethrough line over it
Click the delete button in front of an item to delete it from the list
Add a new item by typing it on the input bar and thereafter clicking enter or pressing enter on your keyboard
